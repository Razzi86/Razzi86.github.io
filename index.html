<p>I am a Software Engineer with experience in Robotics, AI, and Autonomous Systems.</p>

<p>I previously worked as a Robotics Software Engineer Intern at Komatsu, where my teammates and I developed autonomous underground mining machinery; the first autonomous underground mining solution.</p>

<p>I have also applied my experience to making my own autonomous robot car called <br><a href="https://github.com/Razzi86/ana_bot">ANA - Autonomous Navigation Assembly</a>.</p>

<p>I received a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh. As an undergraduate I was the Vice President of the <a href="http://sailing.pitt.edu/">Sailing Team</a>, contributed to <a href="https://driverless.mit.edu/mitpittrw">MPRW</a>'s autonomous racecar, and worked as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistance for Discrete Mathematics.</p>
